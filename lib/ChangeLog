355aaf9c allow creating HfstInputStream's from std::istream's
8ff49aaa Use libreadline in hfst-pmatch when available
b5b7995b [].with(X = Y) feature in pmatch This provides support in the pmatch2fst compiler to define "global flags" with the syntax [your expression here].with(X = Y). This will set up a flag diacritic readable from anywhere within the brackets, even if Ins()ed.
0858e633 Support getting a list of operations involved with a particular feature. This also involves making define_diacritic() redefine the meaning of symbols if called multiple times on the same symbol number.
4d4471de tokenize tests should pass again

b07c47b9 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/hfst/hfst
60e5c288 Check for success of the now-working test suite.
acf3c785 Cleanup of remainder of the pmatch test suite Many cases of adding set "need-separators off"; many cases of fixing mistaken test assumptions; one case of fixing code; one case of removing test that was already in pmatch2fst-functionality.sh; one case of removing entire test because it was trying to do something impossible; one case of relaxing test assumptions that should be possibly revisited. Multiple FIXMEs left but all the tests now pass.
2669274a Make both-sided OptCap() be actually both-sided. It still doesn't downcase the continuation of words, which is possibly a bug.
64a18742 tokenize --giella-cg: remove as_cg_tag, just need is_cg_tag now

be9e214f Instead of names, use pointers to the calling transducers for rtn calls
34bf445c Don't track returns from Ins() arcs in the call stack Pushing returns from Ins() calls to the call stack were clobbering nested calls. This is unnecessary, because we have the necessary information about the correct return location from the stack depth variable anyway.
1358576a Use hfst-pmatch --newline in the tests so we don't see irrelevant blank lines
e6f7067b Decrement recursion counter when returning from main loop due to no input
528952fa A somewhat hacky fix to a bug introduced by changes to RTN processing pmatch is lacking recursion depth with each RTN entered. This is mostly a problem due to eventually running out of depth and truncating results. For now we reset depth at the start of each input, which makes sense anyway, but the leak should really be fixed.
c45f620a In locate mode, omit blank lines even if in blankline mode if we didn't print anything

9fd87e05 Added option --arcs-only to hfst-reweight. Now weights of all arcs and end states are modified unless --arcs-only or --end-states-only is used. Also fixed '--end-state-only' as '--end-states-only'.
e8c1be4a Added some explicit type conversions.
2a773926 Changed the short form of the xerox mode from -x to -X (upper case), to be more consistent with the other options, and to match the test on line 195.
3ba83d91 Now it is checked if foma back-end and zlib are available before hfst-lexc-wrapper is generated. This also affects the way HfstTransducer::read_lexc_ptr is implemented for FOMA_TYPE: native HFST lexc compiler is used if lexc wrapper is not generated.
8557d614 Updated hfst version number in the python setup file. Fixed the argument type of LexcCompiler::setVerbosity from bool to unsigned int.
4a315651 Changed again some 'not' operators into \!.

d726d57c Now handling all stdbool definitions in foma headers.
7137e4d3 Now HAVE_CONFIG_H is checked before including config.h. Removed inclusion of zlib.h that had no effect.
b1ba306d Changed ifdef WINDOWS into _MSC_VER. Now zlib.h is included only when requested with -DZLIB.
a16942dd Using dynamic arrays instead of static ones to keep cl.exe happy. Also added definition for 'ssize_t' on windows.
72034133 Replaced 'and' with '&&'.
beb57e3f Replaced 'and' with '&&'. Also made a variable defining the size of an array const.
9b26e064 Replaced ciso646 aliases and,or,not with &&,||,\!. Also changed sizeof(variable) into sizeof(variable_type) in ol transducer header because cl.exe complained about that for some reason.

f6885672 Added XFSM initializer class.
c8039643 Added function minimize to xfsm interface
4c4ca0b1 Now hfst-compose-intersect does NOT harmonize transducers by default, as harmonizing produces unexpected results with hyperminimized transducers. Option --harmonize turns on harmonization. This is a partial fix to bug #288.
2e99ef0f Added a cross-build Windows patch given in bug report #289.
4cd63b07 Added a missing #if HAVE_XFSM statement.

cc3632a0 Disable hfst-xfst's auto-complet with rl_insert instead of rl_abort, which is not found on Mac.
c41e726e Added a script to generate static binaries.
3a957724 Now xfsm conversion swaps the state numbers to make a more readable state numbering.
b2348d72 Now special symbols should also work in xfsm conversion.
b3af023b Xfsm conversion functions almost work, escaped symbols still need some attention.
b15f184f Conversion functions between xfsm and HfstBasicTransducer formats implemented, alphabets and special symbols still need some work.
5f791069 Autoindent entire file after removing tab characters to appease commit script

db747e7c Preserve nonmatching sequances in locate_mode and parse the appropriately downstream
b7156e23 Tentatively added a skeleton implementation for xfsm library that can be included with configure option --with-xfsm (default is no). No linking to the library is performed, this is just a test version.
74270814 Added a preprocessing directive that defines hfst-twols's Alphabet as TwolCAlphabet if HAVE_XFSM is on. This will prevent variable collisions.
f5794586 Changed hfst-txt2fst's read_prolog into read_prolog_format to avoid conflict with xfsm library function.
424e9f21 Named tokens 'UPPER' and 'LOWER' in pmatch and xre parsers into 'XRE_UPPER', 'XRE_LOWER', 'PMATCH_UPPER' and 'PMATCH_LOWER' because the xfsm library (that might be added to hfst at some point) has an enumerator with the same name in C namespace.
cc5e2fbc Named foma's write_prolog into foma_write_prolog because the xfsm library (that might be added to hfst at some point) has a function with the same name in C namespace.
b7b9a5b5 Took away unused token 'LOWER' from xfst parser.
7701e12e Added an option --do-not-harmonize to hfst-compose-intersect.
ae06ceab Now hfst-compose-intersect harmonizes the rule transducers with the lexicon.
3bfd0e88 Added option --beam to hfst-strings2fst.
b96dd3b9 More accurately name set_locate_mode as set_extract_tags mode (locate vs. match is determined by function call)
47ef7f00 Fix bug in compiling UNKNOWNs on the left side of pair separators
b97a28cb Fix bug affecting locate-mode where ?-matches were being seen as IDENTITIES in input.
ec66bdd1 Added option --beam also to hfst-lookup. It is mostly untested for this tool.
00578471 Tentatively added option --beam to hfst-optimized-lookup.

43d99480 In locate mode, zero-length hits could cause infinite loops. Commit fixes it.
f5c14676 Now hfst-lookup checks it it is possible for an input to go through a transducer before calling is_infinitely_ambiguous. Should fix bug #278.
b4e46558 Now reserved symbols are detected in composition if xerox-composition is ON. This will prevent symbol collisions by throwing an error message, giving at least a temporary solution to issues with reserved symbols.
d2ef4729 Fixed substitution operator in regexp, now flag diacritics are allowed both as substituting and subtituted symbols. Should fix bug #284.
92d2bc0f Added better support for special symbols in hfst-xfst's substitute command.
7cc650e9 Added two tests for hfst-xfst's substitute command. They are skipped until substitute can also handle them.
1ff2f400 Fixed a bug in composition when xerox-composition is ON. Flag diacritics @SOMEFLAG@ were earlier transformed into $ and back into @SOMEFLAG@, but symbols of form $...$ are already reserved for lexc. Now diacritics are escaped as %SOMEFLAG% during composition. This creates a new set of reserved symbols which maybe needs more consideration though... Also added debug prints for LexcCompiler.
ef9407ed Removed xml checks from configure, since they cause unlinked xml references in hfst-edit-metadata on some platforms.
791aeb46 Fixed flag diacritic recognition, now also flags of form e.g. '@D.FOO@' are accepted and an empty string is returned as their value. Also added full support for flag handling in hfst-xfst.
94b723e6 Added some conversion functions between StringPairVectors and StringVectors. Added checks for flag diacritics in hfst-xfst non-optimized lookup.
6df280cf A small fix to hfst-summarize option handling.
479630d7 Ready for release 3.8.2.
d5c85458 Added option --print-symbol-pair-statistics(=N) to hfst-summarize.

5d89abab Improvements to compile-replace function, now it should work for input and output sides of a transducer.
372d184d Revert bungled change to precedence order
06fa073a Now xre compiler of function merge does not increment the char counter, making it possible to have many merge operators inside one regex.
bc322864 Added a constructor XreCompiler(XreConstructorArguments & args) to facilitate passing xre variables to merge function which needs them in its internal xre compiler.
de47594c Now using internal starptr variables in functions hfst::xre::compile and hfst::xre::compile_first instead of global hfst::xre::startptr. This should fix the strange memory errors which occurred when calling merge operation inside a regular expression.
e7c15a33 Now merge operation filters out non-optimal paths.

602ec805 Now lexc compiler warns about one-sided flag diacritics in verbose mode.
fa95239e Added a tokenizing function that warns about symbol pairs, if needed.
4ad8eb44 Added test case for previous lexc commit (sublexicon defined more than once treated as an error).
45826225 Now multiple definitions of the same lexicon in lexc are treated as an error unless LexcCompiler::setAllowMultipleLexiconDefinitions(true) is called first.
95f58f45 Now lexc parser updates the error status hlexcnerrs when hlexcerror is called. In case of warnings, the error status is nor updated.
946bd68a Speed up list arc processing by replacing some maps and sets with vectors
373721dc Changed list to set in merge operation. Removed commented code.
52fe5647 Added option --encode-weights to hfst-lexc.

ed742e98 Now the epsilon symbol is not added as a multichar symbol to hfst-lookup tokenizer if it is the empty string. Should fix bug #275.
0fb0fdbb Allow \U00NNNNNN syntax for code points in utf-8 but above U+FFFF

b0e0fe58 Rolled back earlier revision in interval-set.h
d223f728 Made small modifications for better c++11/c++0x support.
51ff0da2 Fix bug where identity wasn't being set to NO_SYMBOL when absent from alphabet
c2ee5876 Refuse to enter flag loops more than once fixes bug #250 bug - arguably this could be applied to epsilon loops too, pending discussion
15f25c64 Fixed a typo in Makefile.
1faecef4 Now hfst-xfst gives a warning (or exits) if a binary command tries to access a stack with less than 2 transducers.
a7fe5d6f Now hfst-xfst exits if a command tries to access an empty stack if quit-on-fail is ON and hfst-xfst is not in interactive mode.
25255dec Comment explaining usage of hfst-fst2tesseract.xfst.
ed8f0404 Added script for converting morphological analyzers to Tesseract word models.
61b43f5e Improvements to loop finding
4d3bab0d Further corrections to loop detection slowdown back to ~10x but may be improved from here
38bb11f4 Fix some cases of overdetecting infinite ambiguity, there's still some left
f99de3f4 Forgot to keep adding the repeated states in the loop detection phase
f327e834 Only try to catch infinite ambiguity at epsilon arcs This is the big speed win and presumably correct.
aa0928dc This order of comparison is a bit faster since sizes never differ
90b43870 Speed up is_lookup_infinitely_ambiguous() somewhat
3edea32a Try to avoid using negative indexes for arrays
1eedad1d Optimised lookup tests
a1eb3e1c Runtime handling of identity and unknown
dd8a9838 Forgot to remove one thing in the last commit
e1db16fa Take out our own harmonization hacks now that they're unneeded

e6a35c34 Treat special pmatch symbols like flag diacritics for harmonization, also after harmonization add all symbols, including flags, to the alphabets
40feabba Fix bug where delimiters were shadowing the named transducers' names also remove extraenous parsing path
7432ed41 Updated pmatch functionality tests.
6a89ad8b Add string literal syntax for standalone %-escaped chars (they used to be considered symbols which now have to be defined or cause an error)
18b6039d Use minimization guards to keep multiple negative contexts separate in disjunctions
817ec290 Fixed some more spelling errors noticed by lintian.
dcb9e44c Fixed spelling errors found by lintian.

73c2a334 Desperately fiddle with the way the minus operation expands things
ee6d6fa6 Add lambda-like anonymous definitions for controlling subexpression boundaries
9ef36769 Changed the flag handling behavior of hfst-xfst and hfst-lexc. Now both tools by default use Xerox's way when composing, i.e. flag diacritics match unknown and identity symbols. This can be controlled with variable 'xerox-composition' (the default is ON) in hfst-xfst and with option '--xerox-composition={ON,OFF}' (the default is also ON) in hfst-lexc. hfst-regexp2fst also has the option '--xerox-composition' which by default is OFF, as it was earlier.
6a572102 Fixed a typo in hfst-regexp2fst option handling.
a64b247c Now one-sided flag diacritics are allowed in composition when flag-is-epsilon is used.

6d8c1ab5 Add pmatch functionality test suite
d5d441eb Added option -X flag-is-epsilon to hfst-regexp2fst.
33b17d77 Fix another symbol-leaking issue
91d5ce0e Allow nested logical operations on contexts
d4b01d24 We need to avoid symbol pollution for more than just special symbols (this doesn't completely resolve pollution issues, just some urgent ones)
89149b06 Don't forget to pop the rtn stack when there's nothing matched
6a3552fb Minimize after adding delimiters, not before
fdf46b1c Revert bracket-bounding behaviour
fecbf548 Use brackets for extra delimiters to control tag and context boundaries more
51382e21 add_delimiters was happening in the wrong place since recent syntax changes
84678128 Fixed a too strict assertion.
7ac7e496 Added a return value for a case that should never happen to make scan-build happy.
09b12609 Reverted back to the buggy behaviour of function 'getMarkerNumber', since some HfstXeroxRules tests will fail if it works correctly...
c7d12d46 Fixed an error in function 'getMarkerNumber' where istringstream was not properly initialized and returned random values. Also added a print method for class Rule.
7b7f0fb5 Fixed a typo in filename in EXTRA_DIST.
caad8cb2 Now alphabets are copied when encoding and decoding flags in composition. Fixes bug #267.
ad47d327 Oops, forgot about restoring scope state afer entry arcs
f325949e Add a scope facility for local context boundaries
591c5b55 Fixed most scan-build issues other than dead store, memory leak and errors from foma back-end.
d2075681 Added implementation for twosided flag-diacritics in hfst-xfst.
d3c0506f Now harmonize-flags and flag-is-epsilon are by default OFF in hfst-xfst. Also added a new, mostly untested variable xerox-composition that matches flags with unknowns and identities in composition (default is OFF). All flag-is-epsilon functionalitites are moved under HfstTransducer.
ce348d20 Purge commented-out lines
37524618 Major syntactic changes and additions (AND & OR) to bring in line with Karttunen's documentation - amazingly doesn't break backwards compatibility (brobably / mostly)! Function syntax still lags and is incomplete.
79f7b428 Added missing return value to a function in openfst back-end.
636451e0 Reverted back to version 3992.
e0442eea Instead of NULL, return a new HfstTransducer in a condition that should never occur. This is for some compilers.
0d7cdee7 Fixed errors reported in bug #265. Also tentatively added a switch --xfst-harmonization to hfst-xfst that treats flags as ordinary symbols in composition.
08462a75 Resolved another rpmlint issue, hopefully the right way (A HfstTransitionGraph method returning nothing when it seemed to be meant to be returning *this)
68ed253e Resolved some issues and nonissues revealeled by rpmlint
0e2f6766 Now xre parser compiles expressions of type foo:bar^{0,N} correctly.
be1e33dc A better way see if we have a better location than before
ba31a12a It seems to be generally faster to defer minimization at [] boundaries
17b833ba Made 'harmonize-flags == ON' the default for hfst-xfst. Also hfst-xfst's xre parser now harmonizes flags according to variable 'harmonize-flags'.
90cff758 Fixed some issues noticed on c+11 and reported in bug #258: a space between literal and identifier, missing cstdlib header and ostringstream conversions.
9da1a0fc hfst-fst2strings now gives an error message if option --nbest or --random is used with transducers in optimized lookup format.
ddea524b Apparently older gcc's libstdc++ require operator< to be const
f6df4d28 Added locate mode on the library side; support for multimatch, weight access and various internal changes
084d1a64 Now all command line tools should give an error message and exit with >0 if they cannot process input in hfst optimized lookup format.
19595377 Now hfst-invert prints an error message if given a transducer in optimized lookup format. This should be fixed in all command line tools.
5a5a3e46 Function set_expand_definitions added to the python interface.
d89d63bd Updated HFST version number.
26bad712 Updated HFST version number.
78a7e30e Added option --renameFlags to hfst-lexc for testing purposes.
9e7a3ff7 Added option --encode-weights to hfst-determinize.
c9ae91fa Now hfst-lexc has options --withFlags and --minimizeFlags and hfst-xfst variables lexc-with-flags and lexc-minimize-flags to control if hyperminimization is used when parsing lexc files. Flag minimization can be the default behaviour when it has been properly tested.
57cc2df7 The Xerox output should have an empty line between each cohort.
01928da5 Now flag minimization in should work in LexcCompiler. Commented the changes out until all expected results from lexc tests are changed accordingly.
38b37247 Apparently failing to read a stream now throws HfstException so catch that instead
c29a94e5 Tentatively added a piece of code that filters out multiple flags in lexc result. Currently commented out.
8b0216c9 A hopefully temporary tool called proc2 for simple tokenization, to become part of something else or be renamed in the future
ae425925 Some fixes to python wrapping of pmatch and showing original input in pmatch
cee590b7 Make locate() return a simple data structure rather than a string
3ad4e8ef Convenience loader function for pmatch
0cc41abc Fix outdated prototype of printConnectedness() and add pmatch prototypes

2e28445e Added tests for the fixed bug #243 that will pass now.
24e7b465 Now keyword LEXICON is allowed without a preceding newline in lexc parser. Should fix bug #243.
a50dd1a1 Added a variable encode_epsilons to function priority_union whose default value (true) should fix bug #254. Function lenient composition still calls priority_union with a false value of encode_epsilons.
94dc75b4 Added support for cross-products such as {foo}:[bar] and foo:[bar] in regexp parser. Tests still needed.
d42799e2 .NOTPARALLEL for now
85a69f9d Fix serious bug with epsilons in contexts - they were incorrectly moving the input tape.
b04de378 with pipes
941baa99 A super cool progress bar functionality \o/

5282e25f Now binary operations never harmonize special symbols of form @_.*_@. To make xerox rules work, the marker symbols @_SOME_MARKER_@ had to be changed to @SOME_MARKER@ so that they get harmonized as they did earlier.
4312b8c9 Now insert_freely also takes a parameter that tells whether harmonization is carried out.
e979ac2e Now there is an option --do-not-harmonize for all binary command line tools.

ae57f524 Now swig tests use libhfst.hfst_get_exception() instead of catching HFST exception classes. This should make the tests compatible with python 3 where catching exceptions that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed.
6849b3e8 Disabled fsmbook tests from 'make check' by default (enable with --enable-fsmbook-tests) because they currently depend on foma command line tool.
c08fbcc6 Added function HfstTransducer::prune_alphabet which is also used in the tool hfst-prune-alphabet.
c23504bc Added filtering to harmonize_flag_diacritics. It will filter out superfluous flag diacritic paths, which are created during harmonization.
be0e3fd2 Prevented foma from harmonizing id- and unk-symbols with flag diacritics in insert_freely.
8cecacd3 Removed 'words.txt' from EXTRA_DIST as it is not found in svn repository and make check passes without it.

b2139f2d Fixed problem which resulted from changing the insert_freely-function in the library.
65f17f07 Re-fixed flag diacritic harmonization problem, where identity and unknown symbols were expanded by flag diacritics. To prevent expansion in this case, I added a bool parameter harmonize to the insert_freely library function.
220b78c2 Now configure gives warning on missing hfst-xfst correctly.
8499a59f Added a new tool, hfst-prune-alphabet. Also added a new bool parameter to HfstTransitionGraph::prune_alphabet.

eaa693c4 Added regexp substitution
55d27503 regex parser - added left replace epenthesis rule
145ac045 Added note to remind people to also increment the HFST_LONGVERSION. This is important to ensure consistent behaviour between different types of version checks. The different types of version info returned by hfst-info --version should be consistent, the long version should just be a representational variant of the other values.
d2ff1397 Longversion.

bfb86fad Initial commit of the hfst-guessify utility.
ed7b61d8 Complement added to the 'regexp'
167a297f When reading header size, which on the disk is a two-byte unsigned number, we need to call stream_get(short &) because it's not implemented for unsigned short. Then cast it to unsigned short.

bd37642c Introduction of semifunctional pmatch2fst
7870bf50 No plus sign in front of tags in CG mode, not even the special carry-through tag.
24449d5a Added experimental support for printing the raw analysis tag as part of the Xerox analysis. It is printed as a tag with a special prefix, and with the full analysis string enclosed in quotes. The idea is that vislcg, if enhanced to read the Xerox format, should carry  this "tag" through the disambiguation (and possibly analysis), and print it out on the other end. The tag can then be used as input to morphological generation.
9646a733 Print the raw analysis string as a specially prefixed tag at the end, instead of as a sub-reading in the beginning of the analysis.
92ee0bd0 Now hfst-fst2txt functionality test tests whether the program dot exists before using it.

70fe665c FomaInputStream::write_transducer and SfstInputStream::write_transducer now call fflush after writing the transducer. Now the command line tools should work correctly when pipelined.
f6c6432e The regexp [?] was parsed as [?|?:?] by FomaTransducer::define_transducer(const &string, const &string). This is now circumvented by using FomaTransducer::define_transducer(const &string) instead. This bug will be reported and fixed soon.
e4d291d3 Manpages are not created unless 'make man' is executed in directory man.
e47d8c07 Added support for inverting the composition i.e. computing intersect(rules) .o. lexicon instead of lexicon .o. intersect(rules).
37684b75 Added possibility to invert the composition in compose_intersect i.e. to compute intersect(rules) .o. lexicon instead of lexicon .o. intersect(rules). Also added added support for indetity symbols in the lexicon to compose_intersect.

70d24a54 Added documentation to the binary tools about the restored feature that the first input can have several transducers while the second has only one.
7c2399f6 TropicalWeightTransducer::extract_random_paths now also calculates the weight of each path. Fixes bug ID 3514912.
67a377ee All binary tools now handle the case where the first input contains several transducers and the second input exactly one transducer.
e23d373a BrazilianPortuguese2 fmsbook example added to tests
f941d029 BrazilianPortuguese1 test should pass now
6ad4d9a2 hfst-compare now handles the case where the first input contains several transducers and the second input exactly one transducer.

97a0786a Integrate ospell, first commit
2624bf62 updated so that tests don't fail
20ab7961 updated one fsmbook example, still not working properly
9b826c10 Double greek PI met opposition in #apertium, hereby changed to double dagger instead (‡). It is still open whether the raw analysis string should end up in this position at all.
03772d6c Fixed a bug in command-line option parsing, where -e conflicted with all case-handling options.
c96e52eb Fixed bug wrt option counting
a7088556 Added a new option to turn on printing of raw analysis string in CG format output. Default is to not print it.
7c8830aa Replaced triple ] (]]]) with double ∏ (∏∏ - capital greek PI) as the CG sub-reading separator. It turned out that inserting +]]] into the transducer was not working very well.
f06aac34 Deleting the + char in front of GT/Divvun tags for the CG output. Also, there is no problem with printing the raw analysis string, all is fine (contrary to what I said in my previous commit). This tool is now pretty close to what we need in the Divvun work :)
990581e0 Experimenting with the CG output mode. Using the -C option, the output will now include the original lemma+tags string, including all tags within compounds etc. It is printed before the CG-formatted tag list, and separated with ]]] (suggested CG sub-reading separator). For some reason, the tags have lost their initial + sign at this point, so the result is pretty ugly and unusable. I don't know why or where - feedback appreciated.
f3c746f9 Make sure the outputs are sorted before filtering and printing
4905d540 Corrected key string for getopt_long
05fe312d Corrected condition in LookupPathW::operator< (or at least made it more understandable)

ec52c631 Stop before end of output iterator
ae8461f6 Clarified comment
074a25e8 Added an option to only print analyses belonging to N equal-weight classes
6844c9de Typo in error message
97926411 Adding identification and processing of GT-style tags beginning with +. When formatting for CG output, this is important, otherwise the output is more or less useless. This change should probably be enhanced with tests for the requested output format, so that it does not contaminate the Apertium analyser. Please have a look.
756d724c indentation
3e37af1c Added a quietFlag variable, which makes the -s/-q flags actually useful. Using either -s or -q the warning "Warning: Transducer contains one or more multi-character symbols made up of ASCII characters which are also available as single-character symbols." will be suppressed. There might be other output that should also be suppressed, but that is not implemented yet.
784bd214 Removed "e.g." to avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of the output.
cdb80a2a Boundary mark in contexts is beeing handled now.
e999674d Xfst rules parser should be working now

2512805b Ready for HFST release 3.3.6.
3d290d35 Changed include directives of implementation headers (foma, sfst, openfst) so that they search for headers in default include path first. Also modified memory leak script.

4f996f51 Added a test case for the bug fixed in revision 2016 (out_of_range thrown by substitute function).
5e805977 De-spanishify hint string ("argumentes" -> "arguments")
d29274ee Now HfstTransitionGraph:substitute(const HfstSymbolSubstitutions & subs) adds all symbols in subs to the global alphabet before relabeling, thus avoiding the out_of_range exceptions thrown earlier by this function.
467599ea Changed hfst-compose-intersect so that it gives a warning (1) when the rule does not contain the identity symbol and the output tape of the lexicon contains a symbol not found on the input tape of the first rule, and (2) when the output tape of the lexicon contains multi character symbols not found on the input tape of the first rule.

7f0d49ab Ready for HFST release 3.3.3. Also disabled DateParser test because it relies on hfst-calculate.
a2b7ede9 Fixed speces so that the space symbol is used in the transition instead of @_SPACE_@.
8bceff5a Skip copying the foma transducer name to the net, leaving an empty string. Rationale: foma has a limiting 40 char ceiling on names, and we might as well use HFST3-style names for everything.
e90d002f Removed hard tab indentation from hfst-txt2fst.cc
5d4e1ab2 Replaced tabs with spaces in hfst-lexc.cc

9313133a Added a function for querying if a transducer has flag diacritics and added a parameter in harmonize_flag_diacritics for diabling insertion of missgin flags (needed for hfst-concatenate).
e207282c Added function bool HfstTransducer::has_flag_diacritics(void) const
47f9d3e7 When looking for indexes with a particular symbol (which is used for converting to other transducer types), handle flag diacritics specially as per their indexing rules.

edcc8e64 Added missing file.
f24568bc Made small changes to the tests under fsmbook-examples, now make distcheck should work also when scripts in an upper-level directory are used.
e1675735 Tentatively added one subdirectory of fsmbook-examples to the tests performed in make check.
31af546e Tentatively added some testing scripts to fstbook-examples

459bcaad A bug in transducer conversion fixed.
711df751 Don't do foma-SFST conversion if we don't HAVE_SFST
7317a586 Warning about broken foma handling

1084eabe Be more verbose about type mismatch
4e99e3c8 check for empty strings

332fb8dc here here
0a94bbc7 possibly hippu-compatible alias installation
917ae736 Now HfstTransducer::substitute(StringPair, HfstTransducer) does not modify the argument transducer. A test for this case also added.
795926d1 Provide preliminary autoconf scripts for HFST
52f08847 Replaced HfstFastTransducer with HfstBasicTransducer in conversions. This might make HFST slower, but it is needed until the bugs in alphabet handling are fixed.
2fd9cfbe When performing transducer conversion through HfstFastTransducer, symbols leaked from one alphabet to another. Now HfstBasicTransducer is used instead and a test case is added that will fail if HfstFastTransducer is used instead. The original bug is to be fixed at some point.
9779c9b5 Added a test case for replace_up with FOMA_TYPE that fails. Currently it is commented so that make check will pass, but it will be fixed soon.
12dfacfa Now binary operations HfstTransducer::disjunct etc. do not modify the argument transducer.
f933bbb9 HfstTransducer::insert_to_alphabet and HfstTransducer::remove_from_alphabet now pass the tests.
25fd77f5 Added function HfstTransducer::remove_from_alphabet. Currently throws FunctionNotImplementedException because it does not pass all tests.
5447d492 verbose test failures
1085c4f8 Documentation updated.
c6d0e148 Removed check for null-termination of string in the test of string_mainpultion.cc, because it fails on Mac.
49f1dff1 Now distcheck passes the tests but still complains about att files..
e8842434 Reverted r1418 - these files are supposed to be here, and 'make clean' is over-cleaning.
e7725b41 Deleted supposedly generated files - they were removed by the make clean target in test/.
62254319 assert fopen != NULL
cf16a6f6 Modified compose-intersect, so that it will treat only flg diacritics not found in the alphabet of the rules as epsilons.
80c2c7ab A small bug fixed in the newest version of foma in the foma svn. Now the FomaTransducer test works correctly.
ea2f6198 Code reorganized. There seems to be some errors in openfst's minimization, temporarily fixed the situation by pushing weights before minimization.
5aca45b4 Retain root joiners while applying morphotax
afa9e112 kill some warnings by settings
16eabd97 New NEWS

4ad9718b Transducer conversion done through HfstTransitionGraph.
f23ba679 Included <algorithm>...
3856fdc3 Changed member const HfstBasicTransducer &t to HfstBasicTransducer t in ComposeIntersectFst
96e5e02a Fixed bug in ComposeIntersectFst which forced all states in a transducer to have the same final weight as the initial state.
6b74eb4b Sorting the arcs of the argument transducer in the constructor of ComposeIntersectFst, because they need not be sorted nowadays.
0a5bcef5 Added arc_sort member function to HfstTransitionGraph.
2f9d3a99 Some additional experimental container-hacking layer stuff
e238723a left arrow rules
f49a6e12 some more hacks to alphabet.cc
6a3b6422 Added support for rule centers which have the form 'X:a' where 'X' is a set and 'a' is a symbol.
972561a7 Added tests for rules with centers 'X:a' where 'X' is a set and 'a' is a symbol.
475b6f90 Undid some changes that stopped working after the interface of HfstBasicTransducer apparently changed. Also changed HfstTransducer OtherSymbolTransducer::get_transducer(void) to const and added the function void OtherSymbolTransducer::get_initial_transition_pairs(SymbolPairVector &pair_container) const.
48487f20 Made max() and is_subset() static functions.
83cfb8a8 hfst-twolc unit tests added.

c23e9199 HfstTransducer::insert_freely(HfstTransducer&) now uses HfstFastTransducer
1bc69629 check locale in some tools
f0633660 HfstTransducer::insert_freely now uses HfstFastTransducer for foma type. More tests also added for insert_freely.
54900958 Conversion functions between HfstFastTransducer and backend implementations added. Now HfstTransducer::convert also converts through HfstFastTransducer. HfstFastTransducer will gradually replace HfstBasicTransducer for HfstTransducer functions that require conversion.
79722bf1 HfstTransitionGraph now has a vector of states instead of a set. All programs and functions updated accordingly.
3b908de2 Reword slow lookup warning

b15d21d4 Keep information about the parent FdTable of an FdState in the class to avoid invalid reads if it gets deleted
153862dc Changed lookup functions to return pointer to HfstOneLevelPaths, and take no argument for it. Calling functions are (still) responsible for freeing memory.
577e62cf Add more common problems
cd64166d Added HfstTransducer::get_symbol_number, it will be used in faster conversion between transducer formats.
5588a3b4 A small bug in testing the EmptyStringException fixed.
bda6a257 EmptyStringException is now thrown if the empty string is used as a transition symbol.
6923dc2c Universal pair function added
92ece0da Need more inclusions and usings when they don't leak in from backend libraries
ed3be664 Pathnames of testfiles in test/libhfst are now given as getenv("pwd") + "/tesfilename"

7c1efd37 Remove obvious memory leaks
e8bb1685 Added missing test files.
2241e2d2 Prepare 3.0.3
552dadff New NEWS

09baeffc Move stress tests out
8dada878 Priority union function and unit tests
e095ef18 Starting to implement a faster conversion, added file HfstFastTransitionData.h for that purpose. Also separated HfstTropicalTransducerTransitionData into its own file.
50deff4c HfstTropicalTransducerTransitionData moved to a separate file from HfstTransitionGraph.h.
0d2bda51 The pathname of HfstDataTypes.h fixed in HfstTransitionGraph.h
13e58055 A non-existing file removed from Makefile and an include command.
b91dcd87 Including HfstTransducer.h and HfstTransitionGraph.h into header files avoided in most cases by using HfstDataTypes.h instead.
fbcb6904 Made some changes to header files in order to avoid cyclic dependencies.
3b54b9d4 A bug in TropicalWeightTransducer::determinize fixed. The weights must not be encoded, only the label pairs.
f723fba3 Typo in license conflict warning
d23279bb Now the subtraction of two empty transducers works also for SfstTransducer. A test case also added for all transducer implementations.
e6549a36 Now read_in_att_format and hfst-txt2fst also accept a single newline as an empty transducer, if that is the only transducer in a stream.
373523de The library now uses is_epsilon, internal_epsilon etc. instead of string literals.
ceb19424 Added pkgconfig definitions
06fbbe02 Fixed variable LIBHFST_VERSION
40fde0e2 HfstTransducer::get_alphabet declared public. Now the foma implementation returns also special symbols that are not included in the sigma of foma, but foma is still aware of them. Some unit tests also added.
9069af7f Added some unit test for SfstTransducer that test if the alphabet is pruned in operations.
6d7f356d Fixed possible bug in ComposeIntersectUtilities and the find member function of SpaeSavingSet.
d3170ff4 Put stl sort function in stl namespace (which for unknown reasons is apparently unnecessary but it's probably clearer this way).
2d5c8d57 Added more test cases for hfst-subtract that test if the identities and symbols are handled right. Now subtraction seems to work for SfstTransducer, too.
430ab83d Print --version and --help to stdout in standard style

014ad55e Use $srcdir in tests and include all sources
26aeef94 Missing text file reconstructed by guessing
6aedb926 Now input and output projections keep all symbols in the alphabet and have unknowns replaced with identities. Subtraction of tropical transducers handles weights correctly, all paths in the second transducer are subtracted from the first one.
41d2454c Comment out failing test prereq for now (it broke make dist).
9e698264 Unit tests reinstated for .cc files under implementations, compose_intersect forced under same regimen (whether MAIN_TEST is #defined).
6d8743b5 Dummy unit tests for every .cc file in libhfst/src except HfstExceptionDefs.cc
693540fa Tests added for hfst-lookup with transducers that contain identitites.

2b052f53 Changed population of symbols sets in HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.cc so that it relies on the get_alphabet method in HfstTransitionGraph. get_alphabet sometimes returns an empty set, so that needs to be fixed in order for unknown and identity symbols harmonization to be reliable.
492ddf3d Added HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.{cc,h} to Makefile.am
08d99b5c Unknown and identity symbols should now work correctly in composition. Still some errors in other tools in test/tools, trying to get them pass all.
ec358ec9 HarmonizeUnknownAndIdentitySymbols.{h,cc}: A model for how identity and unknown symbol harmonization can be done...

a9645b34 Fix ; separated regexps: * add compatibility function for mac OS X missing getdelim * use delim for all cases in regexp2fst
bdc8a29a Converting to and from SFST format is now faster because function 'check_visited' is used instead of a set of visited states.
32a31617 Conversions between tropical, sfst and foma transducers are now carried out through HfstConstantTransducer, which is faster than using HfstBasicTransducer.

5234e0e9 Added tests for ensuring that word boundary conversions wonät break the alphabet.
b532c930 Changed word boundaries so that they perhaps emulate what xerox does. A "#" in a rule file is always compiled to both an absolute word boundary (which is an internal symbol in hfst-twolc) and a relative word boundary "#". The absolute word boundary will always correspond to zero in output strings and the relative one will correspond to whatever it corresponded to in the rule file.

252e225f more distcheck fixes
53d54a45 small changes made to hfst-lookup
200b383a Added single quotes around and space after the filename for file-not-found errors. Makes it easier to read the filename (earlier the cause of the error was printed flush after the filename, with no space between).
